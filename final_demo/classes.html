    <h2>One</h2>
    <p>my favorite class of this year was WEB because it intorcuced me to code, and now I am hooked, currently I am learning phython by myself after bieng sparked by this class, and I even want to  be a software developer in the future.</p>
    <h2>Two</h2>
    <p>My second favorite class of this term was science, as science is really fun, esspecially during active labs where we get do things instead of just writing about them. additionally, our teachers teaching style and energy level really helped make the class one of my favorites this year.</p>
    <h2>Three</h2>
    <p>my third favorite class of this year was history, mostly because of all of the field trips, but also because of the interesting content we are learning about. Learning about religeons has been a really interesting experience for me, and I learned about major religeons I didn't even know existed previosly.</p>
