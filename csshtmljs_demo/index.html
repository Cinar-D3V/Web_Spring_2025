<h1>Brawl stars</h1>
<p>My website is a Website about Brawl Stars, and all of the characters in it. I have an <a href="images.html">images section</a> and a <a href="charcter_list.html">character list section</a>, sorted alphabetically; I also gave a brief description of the game inside my character list section. My favorite Brawl Stars characters are Mortis and Leon. Both are good for both running away from enemies and getting close to them. I like Brawl Stars because it is a fun game and has a fast pace entertaining gameplay</p>
