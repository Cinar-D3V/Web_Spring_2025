<h2>My Life</h2>
<p>My name is Cinar Gokbulut. I was born in 1967 BC and lived a great and long life. I died in 2008, when I tripped and fell down a set of stairs. Not exactly the most epic way to die, but it happened, and thats that. My fathers name was Sedar Gokbulut, and my mothers name was Fatma Didem Gokbulut. They were both born in 1934 BC, and only lived for three hundred years, but they were always there for me, even when I was being annoying, which to be honest was kind of often.
Only four years after I was born, my brother was born. His full name is Deniz Mir Gokbulut, and he is literally a ball of sunshine... except for when he’s not. then he can be classified as a really loud thunderstorm that comes out of nowhere and messes everything up. But most of the time, hes just a chill guy. We’ve had our ups and downs, because we are siblings but at the end of the day, I’d say I don't want to kill him most of the time.
My life had its weird moments, like living through a few thousand years, but I wouldn’t change it. Except maybe the stairs part. That was kind of unfortunate.</p>
